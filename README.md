Smart Library to load image Dataset for Convolution Neural Network (Tensorflow/Keras)

Hi are you into Machine Learning/ Deep Learning or may be you are trying to build object recognition in all above situation you have to work with images not 1 or 2 about 40,000 images. Biggest Challenges in Bulding a Neural Network is how do I convert my Image into Numpy array how do I load the Dataset before that there several steps you need to follow like convert each image into Grey Scale and resize image reshaping the Images we know how tedious job is that Good News no more Hassle with this Python Library

Just give the Path to your training Folder and it will Automatically process the data it will convert image into Gray scale and then Resize it if any image is corrupted it will handle that issue as well lets see how to use this Module
